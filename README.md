# Abstract

- This project aimed to develop an assistive device for the visually impaired by utilizing image classification, proximity detection, and haptic feedback mechanisms.
- The device aimed to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals by providing real-time audio feedback of recognized objects and proximity alerts to detect nearby obstacles, specifically focusing on recognizing people and cars.
- The developed device successfully recognizes people and cars with a 0.9 accuracy, when powered with a large current source, due to current constraints, initial testing with a 9v battery proved challenging but later testing will be conducted.
- Additionally, the proximity alert system effectively detects obstacles and alerts the user through vibration feedback.
